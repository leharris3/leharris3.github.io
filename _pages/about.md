Hello! My name is Levi, I am a second-year masters student studying computer science at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) supervised by Dr. Tianlong Chen at the [UNITES]((https://tianlong-chen.github.io/index.html#lab)) lab.

Today, my work centers on **AI4Science**, the task of applying artificial intelligence to established scientific fields. Recent breakthroughs (e.g., LLMs, image/video generation models, etc) offer a plethora of ways to improve existing processes. Now, disciplines as diverse as cell microbiology, algebraic topology, and political science are integrating these AI-based techniques in unique ways to make life easier, and do previously impossible things. So, while it is clear that AI is a truly transformative technology, decades of cross-disciplinary work remains in front of us to build safe, trustworthy systems together.

My research has centered on two, high-impact fields thus far: *metrology* (the science of measurement) and *meterology* (the science of weather).

***AI4Metrology***

- From late 2024 through spring 2025, researchers at ASU and I lead the development of novel, AI-based techniques for 2D material image-acquisition and analysis. In march of 2025, we published our results in SPIE as *SparseC-AFM: a deep learning method for fast and accurate characterization of MoS$_2$*. Heres, our key discovery is that image super-resolution models can be adapted to predict full-resolution conductive maps from sparse inputs. Using our proposed workflow, metrology researchers can collect and analize 2D material samples in a fraction of the time. 

***AI4Meterology***

- Traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) techniques simulate the Earth's atmosphere according to physical laws. These models (e.g., ECMWF, GEFS) are powerful tools used by weather forecasters to anticipate future hazards, and issue timely warnings to the general public. New AI-WP models achieve the same goals by a very different mechanism. Using deep neural networks and supervised learning methods, early AI-based climate simulators are showing extrodinary promise for medium-range forecasting. Moreover, AI-WP approaches produce forecasts *orders of magnitude* faster than their NWP counterparts.

- My current research aims to develop skillful, AI-based techniques for nowcasting of high-impact weather events.

***AI4Sports***

During my undergrad at UNC, I also worked with [Dr. Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com/) to build densely annotated datasets for structured video generation and human behavioral modeling using basketball broadcast footage.

This quote gets to the heart of *why* the field of AI has grown to enormous popularity in recent years. AI, at its core, is a **universal process improving substrate**. AI is *horizontal* because it slots into almost any technology stack. My primary aim as a researcher is to find ways to fit AI into important, well-established processes by developing methods that are one, ***nonintrusive***, and two ***undeniably better*** than the status quo.

 TODO: add some interactive, simulation element 
 - A ViT visualizer
    - show tensors and their shapes at each stage from input to output
    - allow users to select which stage in the pipeline to view using a horizontal slider
    - view two stages of the complete pipeline at a time, current and next
