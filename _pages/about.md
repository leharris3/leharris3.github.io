I am a first-year master's student and researcher at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) working under the supervision of [Dr. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/index.html#lab) at **UNITES**. I am broadly interested in problems related to **AI-4-Science** – focusing on applying diffusion models and Transformers to material science problems. My current work explores novel imaging techniques for nanoscale materials (e.g., MoS2), including developing highly performant undersampling procedures for [C-AFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_atomic_force_microscopy).

During my undergrad at UNC, I worked with [Dr. Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com/) to build pipelines for structured video generation and human behavioral modeling. I also built massive, (i.e., 30TB+) densely annotated datasets to push models to their limits.
