Hey there! My name is Levi. I am a first-year master's student and researcher at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) working under the supervision of [Dr. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/index.html#lab) at the **UNITES** lab. I am broadly interested in problems related to **AI4Science**. To explain why, I've attached one of my favorite answers to the question "What is Artificial Intelligence?" below.

This quote gets to the heart of *why* the field of AI has grown to enormous popularity in recent years. AI, at its core, is a **universal process improving substrate**. AI is *horizontal* because it slots into almost any technology stack. My primary aim as a researcher is to find ways to fit AI into important, well-established processes by developing methods that are one, *nonintrusive*, and two *undeniably better* than the status quo.

My current work seeks to develop new image-processing techniques for atomic force microscopy (AFM), particularly for fast characterization of two-dimensional (2D) materials like MoS2. My colleagues and I hope that by bridging the gaps between state-of-the-art computer vision methods and well-established Metrology techniques, we can breathe new life into old hardware.

Previously, during my undergrad at UNC, I worked with [Dr. Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com/) to build pipelines for structured video generation and human behavioral modeling. Together we also built massive, (i.e., 30TB+) densely annotated datasets to push video understanding models to new limits.

 TODO: add some interactive, simulation element 
 - A ViT visualizer
    - show tensors and their shapes at each stage from input to output
    - allow users to select which stage in the pipeline to view using a horizontal slider
    - view two stages of the complete pipeline at a time, current and next
    -
