I am a first-year master's student at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) working under the supervision of [Dr. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/index.html#lab). I am broadly interested in applications of Computer Vision and Deep Learning – including diffusion models for material generation and post-deployment model optimization techniques.

During my undergrad at UNC, I worked with [Dr. Gedas Bertasius](https://www.gedasbertasius.com/) to build pipelines for structured video generation and human behavioral modeling. I also built massive, (i.e., 30TB+) densely annotated datasets to push models to their limits.
