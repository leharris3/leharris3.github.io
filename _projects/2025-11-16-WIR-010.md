### Reflections

Very rarely in life does a week feel like an eon, one you pass through and feel changed, are changed by. It may be melodramatic to say but *I learned something about myself* these past seven days. Starting on the day of the 13th through the morning of the 14th I worked 18 continuous hours! I am deeply proud of myself for what we've accomplished in such a short period.

Looking forward, it's important that we stay focused. After all, our job isn't done yet. Our first round of PhD applications is approaching on the 1st, and another large batch awaits us soon after on 15th of December. By the end of this week I want to have **solid** drafts of all writing materials prepared for the 12/1 wave. Getting ahead of these deadlines will be absolutely imperative to give us room to prepare adequately for NeurIPS. We have absolutely **zero** cause for celebration just yet; the most challenging work of all still lies ahead.

### Looking forward

Action Items
- [ ] 1. Complete *drafts* of all written materials for 12/1 batch of PhD deadlines; **post proof of completion**
- [ ] 2. COMP790.183: Complete HW I
- [ ] 3. COMP790.150: Complete HW II
- [ ] 4. Confirm we have no end-of-semester conflicts; **post proof of completion**

Until next week 👋
