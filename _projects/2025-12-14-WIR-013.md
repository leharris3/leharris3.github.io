### Reflections

I know... I know... we're in absolute shambles over here (an entire week without a week-in-review is a most unholy thing). On the bright side, I've completed **12/15** PhD applications (god bless the last LoR just hit too) and look forward to having the rest submitted shortly! What an absolute whirlwind to the end of the semester this has been. Perhaps when I get the chance, I'll type up an extremely belated and unoriginal "My Thoughts on NeurIPS" post. Of course, I'm pretty sure Lex Fridman has already beaten me to the punch.

For the first time I can really recall, I think I would be better off this winter break, you know, not only doing work things. That means daily exercise, family time, and getting my ducks in a row for a big move coming up at the end of the month (hoping to share some news regarding this on LinkedIn soon!) Fortunately, I also have a bit of interview prep to do as well.

I'm also mulling over putting together another long blog post on something in the coming weeks. So far, I've narrowed down the range of topics to either (1) a practical guide to applying to CS/ECE PhD programs or (2) my analysis of Napoleon's failed march on Russia in 1812 (spoiler alert, many horsies bit the dust). If by some miracle I've found out how to turn on comments in a few weeks, and if if by *an even greater miracle* someone is actually reading this, let me know your preference.

### Looking forward
