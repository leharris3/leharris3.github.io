### Reflections

Yikes... the great "posting the week-in-review on time" streak is finally broken. This past week we basically just grinded applications 24/7. Upon reflection, there were probably opprotunities to take more breaks, exercise a touch, etc... but honestly really not a ton. Going forward, we will be in San Diego for next few days! My grand ambitions for the coming days will to study a bit each day for a belated final exam, complete ~1/2 of my applications, and to make few new friends!

### Looking forward

Action Items
- [ ] 1. Submit UCSD app by EOD 12/2; post proof
- [ ] 2. Study 1+ hours/day for COMP790.150 exam; post proof
- [ ] 3. Complete graduation survey by 12/4; post proof
- [ ] 4. Expand NeurIPS itinerary to include folks at all relevant schools
- [ ] 5. Draft W4C presentation by 12/6; revise 12/7
    - [ ] 5a. Contact organizers by 12/3

Until next week 👋
