### Reflections

Variety is the spice of life, and oftentimes I wonder: could my life be more... spicy? What I mean to say is that, while I am *very* good at sticking to a routine and refining it, it might be wise to find occasions to break from that routine as well. Therefore, next week, I will challenge myself to do one extra thing out of the ordinary. Ideally, this acitivity will be slightly uncomfortable, pro-social, and not work-related lol. 

Beyond that critque, I'd day we've been enjoying a lovely week of relative rest here at home. 

### Looking forward

Action Items
- [ ] 1. Request advising from X for DOE-CSGF
- [ ] 2. Completed draft of DOE-CSGF
- [ ] 3. Ping Y (if needed)

À très bientôt! 🤓
