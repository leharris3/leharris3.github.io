### Reflections

It has been quite the week! I am delighted to announce that with less than 8 hours to go, we currently occupy the number one position on the Weather4Cast 2025 task #1 leaderboard! While we didn't achieve all our goals this week, I am extremely proud of the effort that we put towards this awesome contest. This week, we have ahead of us the onerous task of producing a polished manuscript in just a few days. It will be my only goal during this period to write the best paper I can; to produce some work of tangible merit and submit it prior our deadline.

### Looking forward

Action Items
- [ ] 1. Write and submit a manuscript to the Weather4Cast challenge workshop
- [ ] 2. \*Add new goals here thereafter!

Until next week 👋
