##### A.2

- To clarify, the primary motivation for presenting our work would be to buttress *my* PhD applications this fall – to have another bullet point on my CV. I did find options, even on such short notice. --- is a hydrology-related conference to be held in --- this November, with an Oct. 8 submission deadline. Another option was to rush out a --- tutorial by Oct. 6. However, after looking through previous year's submissions, I decided against throwing together some last-minute junk; slip-shod work just isn't my MO at this point. My co-authors and I will submit our work when it's ready, and likely several months from now.

### Concluding Remarks

So much of what we think is, feel is, productive turns out to be totally impossible to quantify – and is therefore likely unproductive. This weekly exercise is painful. Invariably I find myself asking: *"is that all I did this week?"* Next week I aim to send a little more time doing research, with a primary focus on conducting a solid literature review.

- Action Items
	- [ ] 1. `[RSR]` create an annotated bibliography of 20+ articles; **upload latex document to blog**
		- Breadth > depth; *1-2 sentence description per source*
	- [ ] 2. `[RSR]` in-depth breakdown of the most salient source (i.e., *1 paper*) reviewed in `D.1`; **upload to blog**
		- Depth > breadth
	- [ ] 3. `[RSR]` join/create a paper club; **post proof to blog**
	- [ ] 4. `[LOG]` brainstorm: (x3) ideas regarding how I can send my summer 26'; **post to blgo**
 
Until next week 👋
