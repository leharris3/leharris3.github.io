# **Week-in-Review**
*Posted: February 15, 2026*

### Recurring commitments

##### *Physical and Mental Health*

| Item                                                        | Completed? |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| (Monday) fix insurance kerfuffle; (Wednesday) do the thing. |     ✅      |
| Exercise x3/week; 30+ minutes.                              |     ✅      |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

##### *Research*

| Item                             | Completed? |
| :------------------------------- | :--------: |
| x6 deep work sessions            |     ❌      |
| x1 instructive math/AI post/week |     ✅      |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

- While I'm certain that we did *some* deep work this week, the fact that we don't have any organized record of those sessions is bad enough to deserve a grade of *incomplete*.

##### *Relationships*

| Item                                             | Completed? |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| Contact 2+ friends/day; plan 1+ excursion/month. |     ❌      |
| Contact 2+ family members/day.                   |     ❌      |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

- Just like the "deep work" goal above, it is plain now that we don't have a good system in place for tracking progress for this goal during the week. Therefore, while we've certainly performed okay in this category, two Xs have been awarded.

##### *Cultural participation*

| Item                             | Completed? |
| :------------------------------- | :--------: |
| Visit 1+ new location in Austin. |     ❌      |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

- While we technically went to some new places this week, I don't quite feel I accomplished the "spirit" of this goal, which is likely something more along the lines of: "visit 1+ **interesting** place a week/do something adventurous."

### Previous action items

- [ ] 1. Complete *all* recurring commitments.
- [x] 2. Verify all notifications (mobile + desktop) are functioning properly; include a short comment on my digital environment in the next WIR.
- Completing this action item wasn't so hard, I just turned on my long-disabled notifications in iOS settings. We now receive regular notifications on both mobile and desktop. This system is still imperfect; Apple likes to crush all your reminders into one card, requiring that you go and (1) open your phone, (2) open the notifications app, and (3) inspect your notifications manually. (I know, my life is pure torture!) We should implement something better, perhaps simply by staggering notifications.
- [x] 3. (Wed) Take care of {pesky, lingering logistical issue} ahead of Thursday meeting.
- [x] 4. Purchase a new book; post proof to WIR.
- We've purchased what I understand to be a pretty important novel in the world of Latin American magical realism: *"La casa de los espíritus"*. So far the reading has been slow going; it turns out that Spanish you learn at the college level is still a mostly incomplete and contrived subset of Spanish in the real world, much less the *literary world*.

### Reflections
We are really struggling with some of these new, daily recurring goals! This week, we missed the mark on the following goals:

- (1) x6 Deep work sessions.
- (2) Contact 2+ friends/family members per day.
- (3) Visit 1+ new place in Austin.

One thing we will do to address these problem areas is to *implement better reminders*; we need clear visual cues and indicators of progress (or lack thereof) with respect to time-bound (daily) tasks. Another idea (probably a bad one), is to use some forcing mechanism to instill better habits. For example, we could delay dinner until all daily goals have been met. I like to eat, so this psychologically dubious, unnecessarily male protocol might just do the trick–will implement and report back.

### Action items
- [ ] 1. Call X; make appointment or plan a contingency as needed
- [ ] 2. Call Y; call Z to follow-up
- [ ] 3. Complete 80%+ of weekly goals
- [ ] 4. [EOD MON] Create a simple persistent goals widget for Mac. n x m matrix of goals that a user checks off daily; post proof of working component to blog.
- [ ] 5. Go to $$\alpha$$ on Friday night

Until next week 👋
