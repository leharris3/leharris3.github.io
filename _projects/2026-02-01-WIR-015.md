### Reflections
A key motivation for the week-in-review series is to keep ourselves honest. Looking back at the past couple months, it's pretty clear what's happened: we made a big push to finish my MS program, PhD applications, and NeurIPS workshop submission. After the smoke cleared, I let myself take a few weeks off the WIR, allowing old habits of general laziness/avoidance to creep back in. We'll start this week's reflection section by walking though uncompleted action items marked with an (❌) above.

1. *Contact 2+ friends/day; plan 1+ excursion/month*
	- I believe one reason we didn't achieve this goal is a lack of visual queues. During a full day of work, it's easy to forget about other miscellaneous commitments one's made. Going forward, I've added these goals and others to my *Apple reminders app* [1] as recurring, daily notifications.
2. *Contact 2+ family members/day*
	- Added a daily reminder for this task.
3. *x1 deep work sessions/day*
	- Two points here. First, I forgot that this was even a goal we set lol; added a reminder to my Apple reminders. Second, it may be worthwhile to offer some flexibility here. For example, on Wednesday, a colleague and I work feverish towards a deadline for the entire day. In some instances it may not be practical to do a deep work session every day; will consider adjusting this target from x7/week -> x6/week.
4. *Attend services x1/month*
	- In this case, we simply failed to complete this goal due to avoidance. It may be helpful to break up the larger aim of "going to services" into a few sub-tasks (e.g., pick a place, pick a time, add the event to calendar, etc).
5. *Volunteer x1/month*
	- Despite being interview several weeks ago, I am yet to be cleared to start volunteer work. Still, the onus is on me; there were certainty other opportunities to volunteer impromptu during the month of January. We've added this task to our reminders and will set *Feb 15* as a cutoff point, at which time back up plans will be made.

Another miscellaneous note:  we're going to update the "40/52 math/AI conceptual blog posts" goal to x1/week. We would like to avoid a scenario where we put off this task for the first three months of the year.
