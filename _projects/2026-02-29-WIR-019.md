# **Week-in-Review**

*Posted: February 29, 2026*

### Recurring commitments

##### *Physical and Mental Health*

| Item                                      | Completed? |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| Exercise x3/week; 30+ minutes.            |     ✅     |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

##### *Research*

| Item                                      | Completed? |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| x6 deep work sessions                     |     ❌     |
| x1 instructive math/AI post/week          |     ❌     |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

- We completed (5/7) deep work sessions... so close!
- Due to a sudden change in schedule, we had to drop this week's blog post in favor of some other writing. Given just how intensive these short pieces have been, we might want to do daily as opposed to just weekly check-ins going forward.

##### *Relationships*

| Item                                             | Completed? |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| Contact 2+ friends/day; plan 1+ excursion/month. |     ✅     |
| Contact 2+ family members/day.                   |     ✅     |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

- Very happy to report that we went from 0/2 last week to 2/2 social goals completed this week! Once again, having **visual cues** and persistent reminders of salient tasks is a game changer. If we hit these targets next week, we can consider amending the personal constitution to raise the difficulty level in this category.

##### *Cultural participation*

| Item                                      | Completed? |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| Visit 1+ new location in Austin.          |     ✅     |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}

##### *Religion*

| Item                                      | Completed? |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| Attend services x1/month.                 |     ✅     |

### Previous week's action items
---

- [x] 1. [MON] Arrive at a precise definition of a "deep work session"; modify corresponding software; **upload to blog**.
	- We will experiment with a "living WIR" next week; rather than fill all this stuff out on a Sunday night we will append to the WIR day-by-day.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">

  <img src="/assets/img/2-29-26-dw-widget-ii.png" height="150"/>
</div>

- [x] 2. [MON] Complete back-propagation post; **upload to website**.

- [x] 3. [TUE] Create staggered notifications for tasks like visit 1+ location; **post to blog**.
  - This was a super simple fix; changed notification settings from "stack" -> "list" in iOS settings.
- [x] 4. [WED] Visit (just make a quick drive past) $$\alpha$$.
- [ ] 5. [THU] Begin work on next week's math/AI post.
- [ ] 6. [SUN] Complete 8+ page manuscript for PIML-QPE (figures may be blank but must be CAPTIONED); post proof to blog.

### Reflections

Sometimes, our carefully scheduled lives are suddenly disrupted. This week we endured a few last-minute logistical headaches that caused us to nix the **blog post** and the (I'll admit it, tad bit ambitious and wholly impractical) goal of completing a **draft of our manuscript**. We're going to make some course corrections this week, ensuring that our goals are in that Goldilocks zone between too hard and too easy.

### Action items
- [ ] 1. Add a little bit to WIR at the end of each workday.
- [ ] 2. [MON] Update the personal constitution; update this week's action items thereafter.
- [ ] 3. Wake up at 8:00AM (4/7) days.

Until next week 👋
