# **Week-in-Review**
*Posted: February 29, 2026*

### Recurring commitments

### Previous action items

- [X] 1. [MON] Arrive at a precise definition of a "deep work session"; modify corresponding software; **upload to blog**.
	- We will experiment with a "living WIR" next week; rather than fill all this stuff out on a Sunday night we will append to the WIR day-by-day.

</div>

- [X]  2. [MON] Complete back-propagation post; **upload to website**. 
- [X] 3. [TUE] Create staggered notifications for tasks like visit 1+ location; **post to blog**.
  - This was a super simple fix; changed notification settings from "stack" -> "list" in iOS settings.

- [ ] 4. [WED] Visit (just make a quick drive past) $$\alpha$$.
- [ ] 5. [THU] Begin work on next week's math/AI post.
- [ ] 6. [SUN] Complete 8+ page manuscript for PIML-QPE (figures may be blank but must be CAPTIONED); post proof to blog.
