### Reflections

As adults we run an empire of one: a little kingdom of our own that demands constant attention and scrutiny. So much of my life now is spent managing my network, keeping track of the details of peoples lives, etc, and is in so many ways something far evolved from what I imaged grad school would be like. But personally, I love it. And I want to get better. Reflecting upon this week I realize that we missed several opportunities to take extra initiative and **correspond, correspond, correspond** with the folks who will shape our future. As we enter the homestretch of PhD applications, it's vital that we stay on top of things and maintain the connections we fostered earlier in the year. As a general rule, we should be accustomed to sending out far more correspondence than we currently produce on a *daily basis*.

One observation I have made during the past week is that when writing my SOPs, the first 800 words always seem to come far easier than the final 200. (That is, I struggle to connect my experiences to the work of others, and to deeply understand researchers at a glance). It is so critical that we be able to connect in this way. To, when required, quickly understand the substance of another person and find the ties that bind you together. Because I believe it is possible, honestly, to forge a genuine connection between any two people provided that one person **understands** the other deeply, and moreover has the confidence required to make the first interaction a pleasant one.

Concretely, we have a lot of work to do. Our first batch of applications is due on 12/1. The culmination of years of work awaits us less than 10 days into the future. If there was ever a time to feel on edge, this is it! For six years I ran track and field, and I believe anyone who has shared in that experience knows the feeling of hearing the bell lap *ring*. There is nothing quite like it. That sound marks the end of fear; you feel like you've left your body as another will enters; a simple thought enters your mind: "close", and the rest is automatic. This is how I feel today. We know what we have to do and I have absolutely no doubt or fear that it will get done... until next week!
