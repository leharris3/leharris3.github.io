### Reflections

Whoops! It looks like we overcommitted just a touch last week. Let's start off by taking a look at the action items that did **not** get completed.

- (1) Complete *all* recurring commitments.
    - *Contact 2+ friends/day*. For the most part, we did a good job staying connected and engaged with the boys. On some days, however, work simply ate up the full day and this commitment slipped my mind. Adjusting by properly enabling notifications on Mac/iPhone. 
    - *Contact 2+ family members/day*. Nearly an identical point of failure here; making similar adjustments.
    - *x6 deep work sessions*. Once again, by failing to enable notifications/designate time to achieve this goal, a couple days slipped by the wayside. One practice that we might want to get in the habit of is creating an *end-of-day plan* for the next 24 hours. By anticipating which tasks will be hard to accomplish ahead of time, we can reduce the friction of making adjustments to unforeseen circumstances on the fly.

Going forward, we'll need to start working on our weekly math/AI blog post on Saturday, rather than Sunday night 😄. Additionally, we must, must, must ensure all our notification systems (both mobile and desktop) are turned on and functioning properly. If we let memory and willpower become the stopgap for success–rather than using systems robust to fatigue, poor judgment, and forgetfulness–we are bound to make the same mistakes again and again.

### Action items
- [ ] 1. Complete *all* recurring commitments.
- [ ] 2. Verify all notifications (mobile + desktop) are functioning properly; include a short comment on my digital environment in the next WIR.
- [ ] 3. (Wed) Take care of {pesky, lingering logistical issue} ahead of Thursday meeting.
- [ ] 4. Purchase a new book; post proof to WIR.

Until next week 👋
