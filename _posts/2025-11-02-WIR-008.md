### Reflections

As always, our productivity this week can be characterized as a mix of things that we did well, and things that we did inefficiently/put off. Let's speak to what we did well first.

- We did a great job of making time for/putting forth quality effort towards research-related tasks.
- We tackled some very unfun tasks head-on (e.g., filling out grad paperwork, writing tasks)

And now let's go over some areas for improvement.

- **Commitments**: A few days this week we failed to complete tractable TODO items. It is impossible to understate the importance of upholding the promises we make to ourselves and others when reasonably possible.
- **Meeting Organization**: These week, we had the honor of speaking with some wonderful people over the course of several meetings. I believe that we need to generally improve note-keeping/tagging information from meetings, and storing these data in some systematic way. Moreover, we should as a general rule make time at least 30-60m prior to a meeting for rehearsal/general preparation.
