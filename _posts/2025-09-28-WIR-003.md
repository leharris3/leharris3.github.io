##### AI.2

It turns out there are **zero** requirements to apply for MS graduation. I am happy to report that I applied to graduate this Fall on Wednesday.

##### AI.3

| Due Date | Item | Cost* | Funding Source* | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 10/15/25 | `CS-08` | `N/A` | `N/A` | UNC technical writing requirements; just need to brave gathering a couple signatures|
| 10/15/25 | `CS-13` | `N/A` | `N/A` | Program product requirement; same deal as `CS-08` |
| 11/1/25 | Enroll S'26 courses | ~$200.0 | Savings | Current plan is to spend a pseudo-gap semester in Austin taking physics/atmospheric science-related coursework. [Austin Community College](https://admissions.austincc.edu) offers for-credit courses at $50.0/class. Go bats!| 
| 12/10/25 | Submit PhD apps | ~$1000.0 | Savings | This figure is a healthy upper-bound.

*\*(if applicable)*

- Planning beyond this point is largely contingent on results from this fall's PhD app cycle.

### Concluding Remarks

Not half bad. We made some gains this week. In particular, I'm happy to see that we set aside time to get ahead on high-priority items (e.g., SOPs), and to complete a major research TODO item (dataset construction). Still, we have room to grow. I believe that increasing volume of correspondences/collaboration each week will facilitate productivity and growth.

- Action Items
    -  [ ] 1. `[PhD]` Send 10+ emails to potential PIs + schedule 1+ meeting; upload proof to blog
    -  [ ] 2. `[PhD]` Plan 1+ potential in-person research presentation; upload proof to blog

*\* Anticipating a coursework-heavy week, so our action items are bit less intense.*
 
Until next week ðŸ‘‹
