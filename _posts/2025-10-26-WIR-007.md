### Reflections

- Usually I would have a more substantive blog post prepared, but this week has been as busy as any I can recall. Looking forward: we will continue to drive towards a solid submission to X and aim to knock out remaining paperwork/logistical hurdles blocking the path toward graduation by the end of the week.

### Looking forward

Action Items
- [ ] 1. Complete all paperwork required for graduation; **upload proof**
- [ ] 2. Establish a baseline (50-75th percentile performance) or better on X competition; **upload proof**
- [ ] 3. Email all candidate PIs w/ whom rapport is currently good/timing is appropriate; **upload proof**

Until next week ðŸ‘‹
