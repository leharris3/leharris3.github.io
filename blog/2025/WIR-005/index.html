MRMS offers quantitative precipitation estimates QPEs in two flavors: radar-only and gauge ingest + bias corrected variants. The current operational radar-only scheme Q3EVAP (Zhang Et. al 2020) is a physically-based model using dual-pol radar fields to estimate precipitation grids every two minutes. The bias adjusted QPEs (pass@1/pass@2) ingest data from the MIDAS gauge network, and are available with a latency of ~1 hour.</li> <li>Therefore, when selecting between different QPE products, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between latency and accuracy. Gauge adjusted products can account for variables that hinder ZR relation algorithms, such as beam blockage, radar height, radar distance, and the inherent variability between different precipitation types (e.g., stratiform, convective, brightband, snow, and hail.) Meteorologists issuing flash flood warnings are often stuck between a rock and hard place – forced to use radar-only products in areas where gauge coverage is sparse, and using past experiences to intuit the likelihood and amount of under/overestimation present.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Atmospheric river events</strong></p> <ul> <li>This study explains rainfall events in the western CONUS, with particular attention paid to California and areas where orographic forcing is likely to occur. This region is particularly troublesome for the Q3EVAP algorithm for a myriad of reasons. First, mountainous terrain and elevation variation degrade radar performance. Radar beams are obstructed by terrain features, and so underestimation is prevalent in orographically enhanced precipitation regimes.</li> <li>During the cool season months (roughly October to March), westward advection of warm moist air from the Pacific ocean brings high precipitation to the western CONUS. This process is referred to as an “atmospheric river” event. The authors of this work are primarily concerned with these events as they tend to yield the worst performance for the Q3EVAP algorithm.</li> </ul> <h6 id="method">Method</h6> <p>The authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to estimate precipitation at a point from 2D inputs. In total, the authors select 13 input features:</p> <ul> <li>Reflectivity: RALA, CREF, SHSR, SHSRH</li> <li>Temperature (at a number of elevations)</li> <li>Vertically integrated liquid (VIL)</li> <li>Brightband</li> </ul> <p>These 2D features maps are stacked channel-wise to form an input with shape $(5, 5, 13)$ mapped to a scalar output $y \in \mathbb{R}$ representing QPE at a point in inches. Input feature maps are $5 \times 5$, $1 \times 1$ km grids. All input features are taken from MRMS dataset, and so are on the same spatial scale used by the NSSL. All experiments in this paper are conducted using 24QPE. Some input variable fields only exist at a finer temporal resolution, and are summed over time to derive their 24H equivalents. Input features are normalized strictly between zero and one using per-feature maximum and minimums.</p> \[\hat{X} = \frac{X - X_{\text{max}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}\] <p>The CNN used in this paper is bespoke and relatively shallow compared to popular implementations for natural images (e.g., the ResNet family). The model consists of a few convolutional layers, gradually downscaling the (H, W) dimensions, followed by a flatten operation, a “gaussian layer” (I am personally unfamiliar with this regularization approach), and finally a few feedforward layers with dropout. The model is trained using a MAE loss.</p> \[\mathcal{L}(f, \theta) = || y - \hat{y} ||\] <h6 id="experiments">Experiments</h6> <p>The authors spend the majority of this paper reviewing the performance of their method (CNN) on four case studies, and conclude by reviewing a summary of 112 precipitation days in the western CONUS. Three primary evaluation metrics are used: mean bias ratio (MBR), the ratio of QPE/gauge values, MAE, and fractional MAE (fMAE), $\text{mean gauge value} * \text{MAE}$. In one case study a second variation on the CNN method (CNN-PRISM) is introduced, which explicitly models terrain features and potential orographic effects from the PRISM dataset.</p> <p>Broadly, the authors discover that the CNN method does a good job of correcting the strong underestimation bias of Q3EVAP during cool-season atmospheric river events. The CNN-PRISM variant improves upon the CNN baseline, but only slightly, and evaluate in just one of the four case studies. The authors also note that CNN method tends to overestimate precipitation, particularly in warm-rain regimes. It is speculated that brightband degradation or other orographic-related features not explicitly modeled may account for these lacunas in performance. More importantly, it is shown that while the deep learning model outperforms Q3EVAP in cool-month events, it vastly <em>underperforms</em> compared to the baseline during summer months. The authors suggest that this performance gap may be attributable to these data being missing from the model training set. I would agree.</p> <p>As an aside, I believe that the MBR metric lacks clarity. For example: an MBR of 10 indicates that QPE values are 10 times higher than the ground truth - a 10x overestimation! An MBR of 0.1 implies our QPE is now a 10x <em>underestimate</em>. The issue here is that authors choose to plot every y axis on linear scale, and so exponentially worse <em>underestimations</em> are particularly hard to discern visually.</p> <h6 id="discussion">Discussion</h6> <p>For future work, the authors propose adding additional input fields to model topography, brightband effects, and other variables that modulate the Z-R relationship. Moreover, they hint at adding some interpretability techniques to probe model behavior. Not a ton of thought is put into experimenting with different model configurations, variants, loss functions, data augmentation schemes, regularization techniques, input normalization setups, or problem formulations. I’m being annoying. From my brief observations of the meteorology and atmospheric science communities, I’ve noticed a preference among these groups to focus on case studies rather than large-scale quantitative evaluations. This bias makes sense. Operational forecasters use products like the MRMS suite only within the context of weather events. I hope to use my naivety to my advantage, by focusing more on the specifics of model design and less on the underlying meteorology of the processes I model in my work.</p> <h4 id="a3">A.3</h4> <p>I’ve signed up to attend bi-weekly meetings of this <a href="https://ai-climate.berkeley.edu/reading-group.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BAIR-based group</a>.
