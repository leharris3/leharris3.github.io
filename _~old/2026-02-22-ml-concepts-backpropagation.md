*This post makes use of notation and general concepts introduced in Chapter 4 of Christopher Bishop's seminal textbook: "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition." Readers interested in building deeper intuition of the capabilities and limitations of neural networks–as well as the governing mathematics of machine learning–will benefit enormously from a review of this classic treatment.*

Thanks for reading!
